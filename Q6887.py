문제
Gigi likes to play with squares. She has a collection of equal-sized square tiles. Gigi wants to arrange some or all of her tiles on a table to form a solid square. What is the side length of the largest possible square that Gigi can build?

For example, when Gigi has 9 tiles she can use them all to build a square whose side length is 3. But when she has only 8 tiles, the largest square that she can build has side length 2.

Write a program that inputs the number of tiles and then prints out the maximum side length. You may assume that the number of tiles is less than ten thousand.

# N = int(input())

# N = (N ** 0.5) // 1

# print(f"The largest square has side length {int(N)}.")

print(f"The largest square has side length {int((int(input()) ** 0.5) // 1)}.")
